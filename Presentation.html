# The Problem

> "The deeper I got into TDD, the more I felt that my own journey had been less of a wax-on, wax-off process of gradual mastery than a series of blind alleys. I remember thinking “If only someone had told me that!” far more often than I thought “Wow, a door has opened.” I decided it must be possible to present TDD in a way that gets straight to the good stuff and avoids all the pitfalls."

-Dan North

# Dan North's Guiding TDD Principles

- Test method names should be sentences
- A simple sentence templdate keeps test methods focused (The class should do something)
- An expressive test name is helpful when a test fails

---

# "Behaviour" is a more useful word than "test"

# Requirements are behaviour, too

# Summary - Why BDD?

- TDD is good, but...
- Sentences describing should
- Behavior > Test
- Collaboration
- Your team is more than tech

# What is BDD?

> "Begin with the end in mind. It's hard to get the desired outcome if not
everyone has the same outcome in mind. BDD is a means of agreeing on
that outcome in sufficient detail to create working software. Cucumber
allows you to turn that agreement into regression tests."

-George Dinwiddie

---

# What is BDD?

> "Behaviour-Driven Development, BDD, is a way to collaboratively
specify software that says what it does and does what it says.
The specifications are readable and executable.
When they are successfully executed, the software works as wanted."

-Thomas Sundberg

---

# What is BDD?

> "I do TDD in order to obtain feedback that helps me guide my designs, but I do BDD in order to obtain feedback that helps me avoid disappointing my customers."

-J.B. Rainsberger

---

# How to do BDD?

- Test method names should be sentences
- A simple sentence templdate keeps test methods focused (The class should do something)
- An expressive test name is helpful when a test fails

---

# How to do BDD?

- Focus on examples
  - Features
  - Scenarios
- Describe what the system should do
- Communicate and collaborate
